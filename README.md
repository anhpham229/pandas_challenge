# pandas_challenge

This is the result of my work on Module 4 - Pandas Challenge

How I worked on the submission:

All working files are stored in the PyCitySchools/Starter_Code/PyCitySchools folder, which includes:

- Resources: 2 CSV data files

- PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb: the initial resource file

- PyCitySchools_anh.ipynb: my completed work for the homework

- A Readme.md file is also included, with a report detailing this analysis.

Report:

1. Summary of the Analysis:

- District Summary: The district comprises 15 schools with around 40,000 students. The passing rate in math is about 10% lower than in reading, with math at 75% and reading at 85%. Only 65% of students pass both subjects, indicating an imbalance in performance, where students tend to excel in either Math or Reading without equal investment in both.

- School Summary: Charter schools, with fewer students, show a higher passing rate and a more balanced performance between the two subjects compared to District schools, which have larger student populations. In District schools, there is less emphasis on math, with a 20% gap between the math and reading passing rates, while Charter schools maintain a closer balance with a 1-4% difference. This pattern is consistent across all four grades.

- Spending and Quality of Study: Student performance does not appear to improve with increased spending. Both the highest and lowest spending groups show relatively high passing rates, while the middle spending range exhibits lower performance, up to 30-40% below the highest and lowest spending groups. This warrants further investigation to understand the factors influencing lower quality in the middle spending range.

- School Size: Schools with a large student population (over 2,000) tend to have lower student performance compared to small and medium-sized schools (fewer than 2,000 students).

2. Key Conclusions:

- School Type and Size: Charter schools, along with small and medium-sized schools, show higher student quality and a more balanced focus on Math and Reading.

- Large District Schools: In large District schools, student quality is notably lower, with a significant imbalance as students primarily focus on reading, while math scores lag.

3. Suggestions:

Maintain Smaller School Sizes: Keeping schools small to medium-sized may enable better supervision, thereby improving student quality.

Improvement in District Schools: District schools should consider adopting aspects of the Charter school curriculum to enhance student performance. Additionally, increased emphasis on math could help achieve a better balance between Math and Reading, leading to improved overall results.
